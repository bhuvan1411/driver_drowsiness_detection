Driver Drowsiness Detection using AI and Machine Learning
This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, Dlib, and machine learning techniques. The system monitors the driver's eyes and alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected, enhancing road safety.

Features:
->Real-time facial recognition
->Eye blink detection
->Drowsiness state classification (Active, Drowsy, Sleeping)
->Visual alerts for driver awareness
